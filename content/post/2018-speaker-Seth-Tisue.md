Years ago when I first started learning Scala it was on the job with no
mentors. I had to get familiar with the whole eco system, the language and the
community from scratch.

One of the first and key member of the scala community I came across was [Seth
Tisue](https://tisue.net) of [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com). 

Seth is part of the Scala team at Lightbend and has been an active member of
the Scala community since 2008. As part of his job and interests he is an expert on the Scala compiler and
helps people use Scala and contribute to the language and associated open source projects.

For me whilst learning Scala he has been a most valuable resource where not
only has he motivated me to want contribute more to the Scala ecosystem but he
regularly has helped me and others via [gitter](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) tirelessly. 

We are lucky that he is based in San Francisco Bay area as we have had the privilege of meeting him in person and having him as a valued speaker at SF Scala meetup.

## Seth Tisue's talks at SF Scala Meetup

### Tools for taming tangled code
Clean code isn't only well-formatted, it's also well-structured. What is structure? Let's consider one kind of structure: internal dependency structure. "Internal" because this isn't about what libraries you used, it's about what parts of your own code depend on what other parts. If code is poorly structured in this way, then the code is hard to understand, hard to maintain, and hard to break into independent modules or services. Plus, you'll have very long incremental compile times if everything depends, directly or indirectly, on everything else. 

How can we avoid this kind of mess, or clean it up after the mess has been made? Tooling can provide automated assistance. Seth gives you a tour of tools that can help, including Classycle, Acyclic, and IntelliJ's Dependencies Analysis. And, he will show you a tool he helped build at Lightbend. It's called [Sculpt](https://github.com/lightbend/scala-sculpt) and we recently open-sourced it. It leverages the Scala compiler to provide insight into dependency structure as the compiler itself sees it.

### Scala Compiler Plugins 101
Scala compiler plugins: what are they, how do they work, what can they do? What plugins are popular? You’re probably already using some, perhaps without knowing it. First we’ll survey the plugin landscape, then in the second half of the talk, you’ll learn how to write your own plugin.

## Interview with Seth Tisue
We had a chance to catch up with Seth and see whats happening with Scala, Whats new at Lightbend and when we can look forward and get excited to see Scala 3 be released:

One correction to note from the interview is that Scala 3 is currently expected for early 2020 release. 

## 2018 Talk at [Scale By The Bay](http://scale.bythebay.io/)
We are pleased to announce and look forward to Seth's talk at this years [Scale
By The Bay](http://scale.bythebay.io/) conference [You are a Scala contributor](https://sched.co/FmEv). For Scala to become even more successful we need more open source contributors come to this talk how you can paricipate effectively and contribute to Scala for the greater good.

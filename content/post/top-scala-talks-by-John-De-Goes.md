As I went a long my journey of learning Scala and functional programming the next great community member I came across that has influenced my knowledge and passion for functional programming is [John De Goes](http://degoes.net/). 

We are lucky that John will be doing a talk at this years [Scale By The Bay Conference](http://scale.bythebay.io/) on Scalaz Streams Rebirth. We are even more lucky that he is running a [4 day course on Functional programming](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/functional-scala-by-john-a-de-goes-sf-silicon-valley-edition-tickets-49652715609) straight after the conference. If you have any interest in learning functional programming attending this course is a must.

Here are some of the top talks and interviews of John De Goes that you should watch before attending his conference talk:

## The Design of the Scalaz 8 Effect System

Purely functional Scala code needs something like Haskell's IO monad—a construct that allows functional programs to interact with external, effectful systems in a referentially transparent way. To date, most effect systems for Scala have fallen into one of two categories: pure, but slow or inexpressive; or fast and expressive, but impure and unprincipled. In this talk, John A. De Goes, the architect of Scalaz 8’s new effect system, introduced a novel solution that’s up to 100x faster than Future and Cats Effect, in a principled, modular design that ships with all the powerful primitives necessary for building complex, real-world, high-performance, concurrent functional programs. Thanks to built-in concurrency, high performance, lawful semantics, and rich expressivity, Scalaz 8's effect system may just be the effect system to attract the mainstream Scala developers who aren't familiar with functional programming.

## Streams for (Co)Free!

There are many popular stream libraries for Scala developers, including Akka Streams, scalaz-stream, fs2, plus others in the Java ecosystem. While all excellent choices for building reactive Scala applications, their reliance on effects makes them particularly difficult to test and reason about. In this talk, long-time Scala functional programmer John A. De Goes takes to the stage to demonstrate a new approach to modeling streams that requires less machinery and has more reasoning power, composability, flexibility, and testability than many other approaches. By attending the talk, you'll learn how the best stream library may be the one you get for (co)free!

## The Future of Functional Programming Panel discussion

This panel will discuss the best practices and key challenges for propagating FP in the industry. This is where the beauty meets the beast, and we'll see how they can have the most fun possible, while being at their nicest and most helpful to each other.
